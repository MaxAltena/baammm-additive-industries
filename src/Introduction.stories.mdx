# Welcome to the Storybook for Additive Industries

Storybook is a system that allows designers and developers to view and share components and pages from a design interactively.

We, BAAMMMðŸ’¥, a group of students from Fontys School of ICT, have created this Storybook repository to share various components of the design
created for Additive Industries, during our minor of Interaction Design at the same school.

Our group of Fontys students has been tasked with designing a solution for Additive Industriesâ€™ wish to allow users to monitor their 3D printers
remotely.
Additive Industries builds industrial 3D printers, of which the most popular option is to print metal parts.

We have come up with a solution for both machine operators and managers in the form of a dashboard.
This dashboard allows users to easily access the status of all Additive Industries metal printers and be informed when a printer requires
attention.
In addition to this, it also contains a global planning tool that allows new print jobs to be scheduled and for the workload to be divided across
the various printers.

On the left-hand side of Storybook you can see a list of components and pages we've developed for Addive Industries. In Storybook, it is possible to
check out different types of components, such as primary and secondary buttons. You may also find those in the sidebar, or configure the components'
look and feel in the panel below the main preview.
